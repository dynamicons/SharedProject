    <Press_Release>Dynamic Applications releases Wind Turbine, with a complete Return on Invest calculation.

When the wind of change blows, some people build walls,
but some people build windmills. Chinese Proverb.

Wind Turbine will calculate both Power Generation as well as the Financial Return on Invest of a Wind Turbine for your local Town or Village.

Renewable Energies. Understanding. Sustainability.

This Business Planner will calculate Cost and Profit (TCO, RoI, Interest Rates) of a Wind Turbine, completing our small portfolio of Renewable Energy Simulations, Photovoltaic System and Water Supply.

This Dynamic Application targets to empower you, our customers, to fully understand not only the chances, but also the risks of Renewable Energy production. Will it be worth to Invest your Money?

The Freeware Simulation brings 2 interesting calculation models.

While the first Simulation Model is focused on Power Generation, explaining all kinds of phyisical and thermodynamic effects to consider, the second Simulation Model will help you calculate relevant financial parameters for a serious financial forecast over 20 .. 25 years. As usual, all our calculations are self-explanatory through automated ToolTips. 

Keep in mind that there is no warranty of fitness for your current project or business case. Instead, Dynamic Applications allow you not only to verify all calculations with a Pocket Calculator, but also to create, adjust and modify any Label, Unit, Default Value, Input Parameter, and even Target Formula.

As usual, you are also invited to let every Input Parameter rise or fall over time, so to see instantly their combined effect on Power Generation as well as on any financial criteria, results and overall Return on Investment.

A professional version is available as a Windows 10 Store App in Microsoft Store for a very good price. Through the integrated Formula Solver, it allows you to adjust, modify and create any Parameter in calculation, as well as to create further Financial Forecasts of your own choice.

All in all, Wind Turbine is a reliable application that allows you not only to calculate a Wind Turbine, but also to fully understand and verify the underlying calculation model.</Press_Release>
