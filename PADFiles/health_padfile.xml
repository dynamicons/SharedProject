  <Press_Release>
    <Press_Release>Dynamic Applications releases Healthcare Simulations.

How it works

Healthcare will predict a Virus Infection in your local Town or Country over 100 days.
As well, a global Virus outbreak simulation will show various informations by Country, including the Total Healthy, Infected, Recovered, Immune and Deceased People. Through a small series of Input Parameters, everything is customizable according to your needs.

Being part of the Dynamic Applications platform, it's capable of calculating basically any Formula System over time, including a Solver Algorithm capable of solving (iterating) Differential Equations. 

PM will calculate all Targets, predict and graphically display a company's proceedings over the next 48 months in the reference model. Based on the set of Input Parameters and Formula, the user interface is built automatically by parsing and interpretation of the simulation models's equation system.

Transparency, Privacy Protection, and Participation. our values.

Dynamic Applications are fully Transparent, explaining all formulas in live calculation values.
Privacy Protection. Dynamic Applications are simple Desktop clients that are gathering no data at all.
Participation. A fair chance of Participation and to pursue your own way to Happiness is our Target. 

Furthermore, two Twitter channels are available where users can vote for new Simulation ideas, as well as on the underlying Platform Roadmap Features. We work from Top Votes.

About Dynamic Applications

Dynamic Applications was founded on January 01, 2016 by Martin Bernhardt. 

Dynamic Applications has no flyers, sales consultants, traditional marketing, or budget. Our strategy is called Growth Hacking: we spend as much time as possible on Research and Development of the Software. Following a Step-by-Step development approach, we're working our way all up from the very bottom. We start from crap and make it better, every day. Ergonomy, Simlicity, Beauty and Perfection we are working towards.

Dynamic Applications is a community approach. 
We pay with a Tweet, and vote for the next big thing to publish. 

Dynamic Applications are based on System Dynamics, a well-known approach from MIT in Boston, Massachusetts.</Press_Release>

      <Char_Desc_2000>Healthcare Simulation allows you to load, save, run, create and modify various Simulation Models by Dynamic Applications, centered around the topic of Home, Family, Health, Virus Infections, and healthy food creation. 

The built-in Formula System allows to define any number of Input Parameters and Target Formula.
All calculations are fully Transparent through interactive ToolTips, explaining all Formula in live calculation.

With every Input Parameter, there is a small Mode selector where you can estimate its development over time. Here you can raise up, lower, and square values, define interest rates, or saturation, trending, or Bell curves.

Apply as many Input Value developments in time and see the Statistical Median Assumption of all your expectations, instantly and precisely. This way, Dynamic Applications allow you to quickly and interactively check all options of a given scenario. Since everything provided is free of charge, you can plan your new life secretly on a do-it-yourself basis, and never have to worry.

Full Privacy Protection - no data gathering, no Adware, no Server, no Server behind you. Dynamic Applications are traditional Desktop Clients that are collecting or gathering no data at all. So that you can plan secretly and don't have to worry.

All in all, Healthcare Simulations is a reliable product that features interesting calculation models that are fully functional to load, save, run, and various Virus and Healthcare Simulations over time.</Char_Desc_2000>
