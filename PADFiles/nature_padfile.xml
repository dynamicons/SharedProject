  <Press_Release>
    <Press_Release>Nature Simulations is a collection of Small Business Planners around Nature, Humans, Plants and Animals.

It starts with a children's model simulating a small River from Black to Caspian Sea, at 0 m. 
Imagine fresh, green Trees around Aral Sea, from evaporation of Water in Caspian Sea, filling the Basins of Turkmenistan. So that New York, Stockholm, Hamburg, Amsterdam, Miami and Venice be rescued as well as Cape Town, Bangkok, Melbourne and Sydney. Of course, this has to be balanced with Treaties of Diplomacy.

So that people in Baku, Wolgograd, Rostow and Turkmenbasy are as well important as people in NYC. For this we require long years of desire, so that we see warranty negotiated beautifully. Why do we have NATO warranty, if it's not a capable Treaty organization? - Nature Simulations, starting from v7.24, again rises an innovative idea where no one shall be in sorrow for their own, beloved Family, Future, Tradition and Culture. As promised in the Holy Bible, there is so much time where we're gonna see our fine blue Planet still moving around the Sun. So with The Network of helping Hands with warranties for each family, as declared in dna license, here we just start to imagine that even the worst climate issue could be resolved, peacefully. What an impact to our global future, let's start thinking positive. We the people, altogether, living in Peace with less famine on Planet one. Our Promise.

So that New York, Stockholm, Hamburg, Amsterdam, Miami and Venice be rescued as well as Cape Town, Bangkok, Melbourne and Sydney. Of course, this has to be balanced with Treaties of Diplomacy. Nature Simulations, starting from v7.24, again rises an innovative idea where no one shall be in sorrow for their own, beloved Family, Future, Tradition and Culture.

The Water level Simulation gives an answer to the question how much a filling of the Caspian Sea basin would influence the global sea water level.
