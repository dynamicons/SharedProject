    <Press_Release>Dynamic Applications releases SocialMedia driven App Developer.

How it works

SocialMedia driven App Developer is capable of calculating basically any Formula System over time, including a Solver Algorithm capable of solving simple Differential Equations. The software will calculate all Targets over time, predict and graphically display a company's proceedings over the next 48 months. Based on the set of Input Parameters and Formula, the user interface is built dynamically by interpretation of the simulation models's equation file.

There's a large number of Input and Target Values included with the Application. Employee Cost, Fixed Cost, Marketing Budget (Adwords), Socialmedia Followers, Website Visitors, 3rd Party Website Downloads, and typical conversion rates from SocialMedia to Website Visitors, to Downloads, to Sales. Any single Input Parameter can be estimated over time. We'll calculate the outcome in Downloads, Sales, Total Cost, and Net Profit.


SocialMedia Followers leading the path of development

Accompanying the Release, which went through a beta phase with hundreds of freelance testers, two SocialMedia Competitions have been started. At @dynamic_idea we allow everyone to suggest, favour, and retweet new simulation ideas. Every Month, Dynamic Applications is working on the top voted idea, and it will be available one (1) month for free after completion.

In parallel to @dynamic_idea, there is a Roadmap, Bug and Feature competition at @dynamic_qs, so users can as well prioritize our Platform Development priorities. We call it Customer Driven Development. Currently working on 2016's user favourite roadmap issue, an adaptable formula system with nothing else needed than the basic Rule of Three.

About Dynamic Applications

Dynamic Applications was founded on 01 January 2016 by Martin Bernhardt. He has also been working with two companies in the Strategic Asset Management market, where he came across the System Dynamics development over time approach. Everything else was researched at Google and Wikipedia.

Dynamic Applications is a community approach. Pay with a Tweet, and define the next big thing we publish.

Dynamic Applications has no flyers, sales consultants, traditional marketing, or budget. Our strategy is called Growth Hacking: we spend as much time as possible on Research and Development of the Software. Following an Agile Development approach, we're working our way all up from the very bottom. We start from crap and make it better, every day. So everyone can be part of the game of our own Business Case development. And this way, we offer an exceptional business case for everyone: free software.

We are Dynamic Applications. We work to empower people. We are Sharing Economy. Follow us to gain.</Press_Release>
