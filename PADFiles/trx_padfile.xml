    <Press_Release>Dynamic Applications releases The Reverse Experience

The Reverse Experience (T.R.X.) is a Reversi / Othello board game player, including a powerful game-search based optimization engine that allows you for customization of the game's various play strategies, integrated right within the application itself.

The game's evaluation strategies are based on IAGO, the first computer software beating an official human world champion in a board game. It was our target to develop an even better player. See for yourself.

The game contains a link to an article by Paul S. Rosenbloom, where he explains how he set up IAGO with different strategies, their background theory, and how they offer advantages against human systems thinking.

Within Dynamic Applications, this popular children's game will train you to look far ahead. The simpler the rules, the more far you learn to think in advance, which can be very useful with Dynamic Applications.

Software products of Dynamic Applications are intended to be, and remain, adware and spyware free. 
All we're asking for is 99 ct for the Windows 10 Store App after one (1) year of free and unlimited upgrades, on a voluntary basis. You're testing - it's free.

No Adware, no Spyware, no Server behind, no data gathering. Transparent by design. If you want to be notified of future upgrades, you'll have to follow our blog, or one of our Socialmedia accounts.  

At Dynamic Applications, we work to empower people. We are Sharing Economy. Follow us to gain.</Press_Release>

      <Char_Desc_2000>The Reverse Experience is a very special Reversi / Othello player.

It includes a powerful game-search engine allowing for customization of the game's various play strategies. The computer will select from different strategy scenarios that it will play against you, depending on the level you choose. So game play will be different with each level. Everything is fully documented.

Which should make it a little more interesting, we thought, and could also serve as a nice example of board game evaluation theory. This will also introduce you into the field of strategy scenario variation - learn how to choose from a variety of strategic options.

An evaluation window will show you precisely how each move was calculated internally, explain briefly the strategy you're exploring, and you can compare the impact of the different board evaluation strategies on the total move score.

The game's evaluation strategies are based on IAGO, the first computer software beating an official human world champion in a board game. The game contains a link to an article by Paul S. Rosenbloom where he explains how he set up IAGO with different strategies, their background theory, and how they offer advantages against human systems thinking.

The game and its download are free for personal use under the terms of the dna license included with the program's installer.</Char_Desc_2000>
