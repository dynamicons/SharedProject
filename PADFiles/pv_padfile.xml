  <Press_Release>
    <Press_Release>Dynamic Applications releases Photovoltaic System with Prosumer Electricity Trading.

Photovoltaic System allows to calculate the perfect Number of PV Panels on your House, worldwide.

It will calculate all Targets over time, predict and graphically display a PV System Amortization over 30 years. Photovoltaic System allows you to not only enter all relevant Input Parameters describing a PV installation, its parts, cost, and Network Electricity prices, it also allows you modify each Input Value over time. Simulate rising Net Price developments, Household consumption, Self Consumption Rate.

See their combined outcome on the spot, including a Result Diagram over 30 years. See Installation cost, Installed Capacity, Effective Capacity, Network feed-in profit, Network buy-from cost, Total Cost of Ownership over Time, ROI, estimated Self Consumption Rate and Autarky Rate. 

Fine-tune all Input Parameters to find your "sweet spot" - the best, most efficient PV installation you desire.


SocialMedia Followers leading the path of Development

Accompanying the Release, which was prepared through a long beta phase with more than 1000 SocialMedia freelance testers, two SocialMedia Competitions have been started. At twitter.com/dynamic_idea, a public voting competition allows everyone to suggest, favour, and retweet new simulation ideas. 

Roadmap 

In parallel to @dynamic_idea, there is a Roadmap, Bug and Feature competition at @dynamic_qs. Every month, we work on the top voted @dynamic_qs roadmap feature. As soon as finished, we publish new simulation models from @dynamic_idea.

Customer Driven Development. Pay with a tweet, and define the next big thing we publish for free.

      <Char_Desc_450>Simulate the amortization of a Photovoltaic System over 20..40 years, including Prosumer Electricity Trading. Fine-tune as many cost, production, and revenue parameters as you want. See Total Amortization and relative Net Profit results over 20, 30, 40, 50 years, as you prefer. PV System allows for Return-on-Invest (ROI) and Ownership Cost (TCO) calculations over time, and allows to get a quick overview over possible scenarios and  options.</Char_Desc_450>
      <Char_Desc_2000>Photovoltaic System allows you to simulate the amortization of a PV System over 20..40 years. In the single window application, you have to enter the number of PV Panels, their capacity, the angle of your house towards the sun, and sunshin per year. You can fine-tune as many cost-driving, efficiency, and sales parameters as you want, for example, your household consumption over time. 

Photovoltaic System's integrated Result Graph will show you the development of all selected Target parameters from year 0 to year 40, immediately. To allow for a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Return on Invest (RoI) calculations, a Prosumer Electricity Trading simulation allows to determine the net profit in relation to buying electricity from your Electricity Network, and show you how much you can earn from selling your own PV Energy to the local Network Supplier.

Photovoltaic System is the first standalone application based on the Dynamic Applications platform of free 21st century business models. Through automated ToolTips, the whole calculation is Transparent and fully self-explanatory, showing all formulas in live number calculation. We're also protecting your privacy. No data gathering, no Server behind you. It's your business. We respect that. 

The integrated Formula Editors are available for the top 12 Input and Target Values in the free version. So you can rename and translate Dynamic Applications to your own language or requirements.

All in all, Photovoltaic System is a reliable simulation with professional calculation models that can save you hundreds of Euro or Dollar when buying the first PV System for your own house.</Char_Desc_2000>
