  <Press_Release>
    <Press_Release>Dynamic Applications releases 21st century worldwide growth of Forest, a post-climate CO2 effects simulation.

How it works

21st century worldwide growth of Forest is a simulation model in System Dynamics, a prediction method that became popular through the Club of Rome's study "The limits to Growth". We list worldwide ressources in Coal, Gas and Crude Oil, as well as estimations for yearly worldwide delivery of fossile ressources. From there, we calculate CO2 production, as well as evaporation, clouds, rainfall and the 21st century worldwide growth of Forest, per continent.

We allow the user to verify any formula we have ever used. All you need is a simple pocket calculator and the basic Rule of Three. Promo Codes are hidden right within the Tweets of our Dynamic Idea and Roadmap competition on Twitter, world's fastest network, for free. It's part of the game. As soon as you find them, you can activate all features of Perfect Desire, our professional application, for free. It will allow you to extend the simulation model by adding new Input Values and modify Target Formulas in an Excel-Style editor, right from within the application.

SocialMedia Followers leading the path of Development

Accompanying the Release, which went through a beta phase with hundreds freelance testers, two SocialMedia Competitions have been started. At @dynamic_idea, a public voting competition allows everyone to suggest, favour, and retweet new simulation ideas.

Public Roadmap 

In parallel to @dynamic_idea, there is a public Roadmap Feature competition at @dynamic_qs, so users can as well prioritize our roadmap. We call it Customer Driven Development.

Since our roadmap is community defined, we try to give every person in the world a fair chance to participate, supposed they can get access to a free Twitter account. 

Every month, we work on the top voted @dynamic_qs platform feature, up to the full month.
If time remains, we publish top voted simulation models from @dynamic_idea.

This way, we are Sharing Economy. It's an experiment in Swarm Intelligence. We define Online Democracy in idea and roadmap voting, and develop free Apps to participate from results. Is it possible? - we say yes.

      <Char_Desc_2000>Ever heard about the Greenhouse effect? - this simulation is looking post the climate discussion. How much fossile ressources are there? how much Coal, Gas and Oil do we deliver? - if we continue to fire it up, how much CO2 is that? - how much Water is there in the Clouds, and how fast will Forest grow if we got more? - This simulation will allow you to check it all out, so think self, we say. 

Grow Earth's Ressources over time. All Formulas explained through automated ToolTips, with live values of the simulation. Dynamic Applications allow you to define any formula system, change Input Values over time, inspect Target Values and modify all Formula. So you can really check out the world, adjusting everything you see according to your needs. 

You don't have to believe in Polititicans, Scientists, Wikipedia, or Google. What you make of this basic climate simulation, is completely up to you. Automated result diagrams will show you the precise, mediated statistical estimation and consequences of all your presets and assumptions. The only requirement is that you believe in the existance of Math. In case you find a formula where you say you can do it better, each of them no more complex than the simple Rule of Three. So you can fix the software on the spot. 

Dynamic Applications is a participative organization, following Customer driven development. Two competitions on Twitter, world's fastest network, will allow you to vote with Retweets and Favs for the best new simulation idea, as well as the top requirement for our public roadmap. The work is prioritized by public vote.</Char_Desc_2000>
