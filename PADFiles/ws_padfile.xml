  <Press_Release>
    <Press_Release>Dynamic Applications releases Water Supply, including a Household's Water Reservoir Battery energy calculation.

The Water Supply Simulation is a Small Business calculator by Dynamic Applications that allows you to calculate cost, effort, time and volume of your own, self-built House Well. Includes a sophisticated, enhanced Water Reservoir Battery Simulation. Is it possible? - we say yes. 

But does it really make sense if we consider gravitation to be one of the weakest powers that there is, considering that you need a whole planet to connect a 100 kg person to its surface?

With Newton's gravitation formula for height energy, E = m * g * h and knowing that one Newton Meter is only a Watt second (1 Nm = 1 J = 1 Ws = 1/3600 000 kWh), it's getting astonishing close to feed your fridge overnight. 

How do Pirates fit into that picture? - the Water Supply Simulation page by Dynamic Applications answers that. 

Furthermore, includes the Bakery Tutorial, an introductory simulation that allows you to bake and sell your own bread. Food and Drink - Dynamic Applications has world's basic answers.</Press_Release>

      <Char_Desc_2000>The Water Supply Simulation is a calculator by Dynamic Applications that allows you to calculate cost, effort, time and volume of your own, self-built House Well, including a Water cylinder, turbine and dynamo based house battery. 

But does it really make sense if we consider gravitation to be one of the weakest powers that there is, considering that you need a whole planet to connect a 100 kg person to its surface? - with Newton's gravitation formula for height energy, E = m * g * h and knowing that one Newton Meter is only a Watt second, it's getting close. So we calculate a completely sustainable house with a Water Supply Battery, as an example of what's possible with Dynamic Applications. A Battery that consists of a huge Water Cylinder right within your own house, dynamically filled up and down by a small Turbine and dynamo. Does it make sense? - You'll see, it's really possible but as these Energies are defined, it's getting close.

All calculations are fully transparent via the integrated ToolTip system, documenting all formula and values in live calculation. Dynamic Applications are traditional Desktop calculators, gathering no data at all, perfectly protecting all your plans. 

Water Supply includes the Bakery Tutorial, an introductory simulation that allows you to bake and sell your own bread. As well, Water Supply includes an introductory Photovoltaic System simulation for creating your own Energy, free of any network supplier in theory. 

For the top 12 Input and Target Values, the integrated Formula System editors allow you to rename, translate, and redefine any formula directly within the application. Apart from that, Dynamic Applications are fully functional in the free version, so you can play around to build your own Water Supply, as well as step into creating a small business of any kind. 

Water Supply. build tool, dig down, build well, grow food, supply more families.
Food and Drink - Dynamic Applications has world's basic answers.</Char_Desc_2000>
