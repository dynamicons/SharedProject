    <Press_Release>Dynamic Applications releases Water Supply, including a Household's Water Reservoir Battery energy calculation.

The Water Supply Simulation is a Small Business calculator by Dynamic Applications that allows you to calculate cost, effort, time and volume of your own, self-built House Well. Includes a sophisticated, enhanced Water Reservoir Battery Simulation. Is it possible? - we say yes. 

But does it really make sense if we consider gravitation to be one of the weakest powers that there is, considering that you need a whole planet to connect a 100 kg person to its surface?

With Newton's gravitation formula for height energy, E = m * g * h and knowing that one Newton Meter is only a Watt second (1 Nm = 1 J = 1 Ws = 1/3600 000 kWh), it's getting astonishing close to feed your fridge overnight. 

How do Pirates fit into that picture? - the Water Supply Simulation page by Dynamic Applications answers that. 

Furthermore, includes the Bakery Tutorial, an introductory simulation that allows you to bake and sell your own bread. Food and Drink - Dynamic Applications has world's basic answers.</Press_Release>

      <Char_Desc_2000>The Water Supply Simulation is a calculator by Dynamic Applications that allows you to calculate cost, effort, time and volume of your own, self-built House Well. Includes a simple House Water Reservoir Battery Simulation. 

But does it really make sense if we consider gravitation to be one of the weakest powers that there is, considering that you need a whole planet to connect a 100 kg person to its surface? - with Newton's gravitation formula for height energy, E = m * g * h and knowing that one Newton Meter is only a Watt second, it's getting close. So we calculate a completely sustainable house with a Water Supply Battery, as an example of what's possible with Dynamic Applications.

All calculations are fully transparent via the integrated ToolTip system, documenting all formula and values in live calculation. Dynamic Applications are gathering no data at all, perfectly protecting all your plans. And finally, Dynamic Applications are participative. Two voting competitions on Twitter, world's fastest network, are defining our path to follow. The work on Dynamic Applications is prioritized from the top public votes on the best dynamic idea and platform features of all times.

Finally, Water Supply includes the Bakery Tutorial, an introductory simulation that allows you to bake and sell your own bread. For the top 12 Input and Target Values, the integrated Formula System editors allow you to rename, translate, and redefine any formula directly within the application. Apart from that, Dynamic Applications are fully functional in the free version, so you can play around and calculate to build your own Water Supply, as well as step into creating a small business of any kind.
