    <Press_Release>Dynamic Applications releases Smart Grid Simulations, an innovation in Law.

Smart Grid Simulations is a collection of interactive Business Planners featuring PV System, Wind Turbine, Water Supply, Apple Tree, and Public Infrastructure calculations that will allow you to review the Topic of Public Infrastructure from all kinds of perspectives. From Man and Woman, House and Family with Self Supply, to the overview of The Federal Republic of Germany's most common Fossile and Renewable Energies, this small application allows you to get your own picture, independent from other sources.

Transparency - through interactive ToolTips, all calculations are self-explanatory in formula and live numbers.
Privacy Protection - no data gathering, no Server behind you. a traditional Desktop Client with no data transfer.
Participation - free of charge in the basic version, available on hundreds of Freeware and Shareware Websites.

Through the Dynamic Idea and Roadmap competition, every user can as well participate in a global voting of new Simulation Ideas (mutation) and as well the development of the Dynamic Applications platform (evolution).

Finally, in providing Protocol Form, Smart Grid Simulations celebrates the arrival of Justice at Court, on a global scale. Defended with 75 Euro according to the AGB, Terms and Conditions of Dynamic Applications, before the Law by Martin Bernhardt. Protocol Form will allow everyone to defend the Law in Court, including any unfair treatment that there may have existed. So here we warrant Article 6 of the UN declaration of Human Rights, your Formal Existence where it counts. By defining our Liability, this innovation forms a relation in distance and time, requiring even any Judge and State Attorneys to Travel to AG Lemgo and bring down Protocol Form to get their 75 Euro by bringing up any Laws against it. Still, that's 7500 times the cost of 1 ct of a Din A4 page.

An integrated Formula Editor allows you to adjust the Top 12 Input and Target Values according to your needs in the free version. For a decent price, everyone interested can upgrade to our Professional Business Model Development right from within the application, on request. Apart from that, users can collect dna coins and as well activate additional features through our Universal Promo Code, available within the Tweets of the Dynamic Idea and Roadmap Competition.
