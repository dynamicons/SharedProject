    <Press_Release>Dynamic Applications releases Startup Informer, your personal digital assistant.

Startup Informer is your personal digital assistant,
an automated SocialMedia manager for the 21st century Founder or Foundress.

Ever thought about that in being a 21st century Startup or Small Business, and you're so very small, chanceless almost, while your competition is wealthy and prospering on an obsolete, 20th century business idea?

Visibility.

it's one of the greatest battles on earth. Google's whole Business Model is based on selling Visibility.

Your adword of choice, just 10 cents per click, and don't they have a powerful configuration site. The Power of Big Data, right before you. Keywords, Countries, interest groups, man and woman, rich and poor. They have collected it all. We the people, ripped of. worldwide available. It's not only the data, you know. It's your Money as well. In paying Google for Adwords, and if it's just the 1 Euro per day that you pay for them becoming wealthy. Google wins. you lose. And your customers are paying the price. Do you see any happy customers around here?

it'll make Google rich, while you have to raise prices and your customers suffer over time, as well as your business. With 1 Euro per day, that's 30 Euro per month. With 10 Euro per day, it's 300 Euro of additional cost per month, already. And so, they sell Selection. But the more you concentrate on Adwords and Marketing, the less time you got to work on the beauty of your products. Your competitor goes ahead, their visitors are coming in already, now do you have the courage to doubt? 

Your core offering. 
Your chance.
Your way to Success.

Wasn't that what you wanted to concentrate on, all the time?

Your life has purpose. 
Your story is important. 
Your dreams count. 
Your voice matters. 
You were born to make an impact.

Startup Informer 

configured easily through a high-level user interface, it'll nicely take over, whenever you're busy creating new wonderworks for your customers. A graphical user interface will take care of all your settings.

You're working.

Startup Informer will take care of keeping your fan crowd up to date.

Take interesting content from all kinds of sources and create a beautiful timeline for all of your followers. Mix digital content with personal, hand-written information, no problem at all. This personal, interactive behavior is actually strongly encouraged.

Man and machine. together.
