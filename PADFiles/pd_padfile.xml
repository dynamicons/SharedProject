  <Press_Release>
    <Press_Release>Dynamic Applications releases Predicted Desire, - the final version.

This is the final version of Predicted Desire, a simple and easy product calculation client.
From v2.0, Predicted Desire will be called Startup Product Manager.

We keep this version and continue to host PD through 2018.


How it works

Predicted Desire will calculate your product's various cost, revenue and net profit over 48 months. 

Being the first ever sample of the Perfect Desire platform, it's capable of calculating basically any Formula System over time, including a Solver Algorithm capable of solving simple Differential Equations. 

PD will calculate all Targets, predict and graphically display a company's proceedings over the next 48 months in the reference model. Based on the set of Input Parameters and Formula, the user interface is built automatically by parsing and interpretation of the simulation models's equation system.


SocialMedia Followers leading the path of Development

Accompanying the Release, which went through a beta phase with a few hundred freelance testers, two SocialMedia Competitions have been started. At twitter.com/dynamic_idea, a public voting competition allows everyone to suggest, favour, and retweet new simulation ideas. Every Month, Dynamic Applications is working on the top voted idea, and it will be available one (1) month for free, at least, for the SocialMedia crowd after completion.


Roadmap 

In parallel to @dynamic_idea, there is a Roadmap, Bug and Feature competition at @dynamic_qs, so users can as well prioritize our product Roadmap. We call it Customer Driven Development.

Since our roadmap is community defined, we try to give every person in the world a fair chance to participate, supposed they can get access to a free Twitter account. 

This way, we are Sharing Economy. It's an experiment in Swarm Intelligence, as we define Online Democracy. Is it possible? - we say yes. 


About Dynamic Applications

Dynamic Applications was founded on January 01, 2016. The Founder and first Software Developer of Dynamic Applications is Martin Bernhardt. He has researched not only any public information about the System Dynamics approach, but has also been working with two companies in the Strategic Asset Management market.

Dynamic Applications has no flyers, sales consultants, traditional marketing, or budget. Our strategy is called Growth Hacking: we spend as much time as possible on Research and Development of the Software. Following an Agile Development approach, we're working our way all up from the very bottom. We try to make the crap we started from better, every day. We just hope there are people out there who'll find our products any useful.

Dynamic Applications is a community approach. We pay with a Tweet, and define the next big thing to publish. 

We are Dynamic Applications. We work to empower people. We are Sharing Economy. Follow us to gain.</Press_Release>
